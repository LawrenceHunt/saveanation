# Save a Nation

Our deployed app is found (here)[http://saveanation.herokuapp.com]

### Solve the affordable housing problem

Unfortunately in current times, most people cannot afford to save for a house alone. We want to help.

Save a Nation wants to:
* Make housing affordable
* Change spending behaviours
* Provide more than just material motivation for spending

The Save a Nation app provides a way for people to save with friends and get on the property ladder together!

Users connect with their friends and set a savings target, both personal and joint.

Use the app to save where you can. Dodged that second pint? Got the night bus? One tap and the money goes towards your target and is visible to your entire team. High five each other all the way.

Adding to your balance creates virtual cash-monies to build a team house. Smash your weekly targets and watch the dream take shape!
