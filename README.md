# Save a Nation

Our deployed app can be found [here](http://saveanation.herokuapp.com]).

### Solve the affordable housing problem

Unfortunately in current times, most people cannot afford to save for a house alone. We want to help.

Save a Nation wants to:
* Make housing affordable
* Change spending behaviours
* Provide more than just material motivation for spending

The Save a Nation app provides a way for people to save with friends and get on the property ladder together!

Users connect with their friends and set a savings target, both personal and joint.

Use the app to save where you can. Dodged that second pint? Got the night bus? One tap and the money goes towards your target and is visible to your entire team. High five each other all the way.

Adding to your balance creates virtual cash-monies to build a team house. Smash your weekly targets and watch the dream take shape!

### Why Meteor?

We were all keen to try a new stack for our project. We were confident we could use our newly-acqured language-agnostic skills to produce the something awesome.

Meteor is a full-stack JavaScript framework, using it both on the back and front end. It is fast and everything happens in real-time. With our vision of a game that many members of a team could take part in, the ability for real-time gameplay was very enticing.

### Onwards and upwards
* Unlock achievement badges
  * You didn't buy coffee 5 times this week - unlock an armchair!
  * Cooking dinner instead of getting take out last Friday - unlock a new lamp.
  * Got the tube home instead of a taxi - unlock new wallpaper.
* Hook it up with a real bank account, e.g. Monzo, so the money can be saved in realtime.
* Build up the game properly. At the minute it is a proof of concept but it has enormous potential.
